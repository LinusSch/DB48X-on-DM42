The provided SVG file can be used to generate PNG files suitable for use on a Cricut cutting machine.

This SVG file was generated with Inkscape in Windows - Mac users will find issues with fonts, so I recommend sticking with Windows.

Fonts Required:
- Baskerville (for a few of the function labels (like x-root-of-y))
- DIN Condensed (majority of the text on the label)
- Snell Roundhand (for the script logo text)
- Printed Circuit Board (for the db48x/db50x logo)  https://www.dafont.com/printed-circuit-board.font
- Metropolis (for the number keys - optional)

Some of the fonts required are Adobe fonts, and were already available on my Mac.  I had to export them from the Mac to Windows to be able
to use them on those PCs.  I cannot share them here - they must be obtained on your own accord.

NOTE: The tabbed overlay is not always going to work with the DM42 due to variation in the size of the tab slots on the calculator, so consider
	this tabbed version a "YMMV" solution.  The adhesive option should always work.

Premade PNG files are available in this repo.  These are named with the date appended to 
	the ends of the filenames in MMDDYY format.  I recommend using the newest files available. If you feel the need to make any tweaks,
	the source SVG files are provided.

If you are a Cricut user and want to use Cricut DesignSpace to make the cuts:
	- Use the Upload tool to import the PNG files into DesignSpace, selecting the "Complex" option
	- At the end of the process, choose the "Print then Cut" image option
	- Add the newly uploaded image to the Canvas
	- Rescale the size of the image on the Canvas to match the dimensions of the original file (note that DesignSpace
		uses cm for the scale, so adjust accordingly from mm).
	- Make it!
	- Click the Send to Printer button, and make sure that the "Add Bleed" and "Use System Dialog" are selected.
	- Print it on either self-adhesive printable vinyl or appropriate paper stock
	- After printing, apply lamination sheet to the front of the printed document
	- For the tabbed overlay, I also apply another lamination sheet to the back for better durability
	- Follow normal process for loading into the machine and cutting
