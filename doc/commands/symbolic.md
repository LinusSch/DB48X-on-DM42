# Operations with Symbolic Expressions

## Rewrite

Applies an arbitrary transformation on equations. The first argument is the
equation to transform. The second argument is the pattern to match. The third
argument is the replacement pattern. Patterns can contain variable names, which
are substituted with the corresponding sub-expression.

`Eq` `From` `To` â–¶ `Eq`

Examples:
* `'A+B+0' 'X+0' 'X' rewrite` returns `'A+B'`
* `'A+B+C' 'X+Y' 'Y-X' rewrite` returns `'C-(B-A)`
